          <p>A little badge I made out from the laser cutting machine</p></br></br>
          <p class="h2">For laser cutting, we have to first open a app called, we can use tools to make out the pictures and maybe some rectangles or something, we make the layout of the wanted product. There is another app called that is specifically designed for wirting up the data of a box for you. I made a little badge using the laser cutter, first I drew a big circle in the app and I drew a 'X' beside it that will be the big X in the middle of the badge. After finishing up the data and details of the badge, I put the data of the badge into an specific app that transfer the data up to the laser cutting machine, then I just pressed start and the 'X'badge was made.</p>

        <p>This is the waving robot that I made out from the microbit.</p>

</br>
</br>

        <p class="h2"> Week two I did a little bit of programming on the microbit.</p>

<p class="h2">I used  the microbit and a central controller to put some input or output on it. I decided to make a waving robot out of it, I put in the program that says when the bottom 0 is pressed the two fans that were connected to it will start to wave 90 degress up and stop for one second, it waves 90 degress back down after that. I connected the two fans to the microbit by some wires, and after that I just need to finish with the programming that tells it to wave when someone push the bottom that is connected to 0. the final product will wave it's hand when you press the 0 bottom and you can see it waves it hands after the turining on sentence</p>
